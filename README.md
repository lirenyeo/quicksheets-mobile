# QuickSheets Mobile App 1

A Hybrid app built with Ionic framework. My first hands-on AngularJS 1 and Ionic 1.
Quicksheets is a personal budget app that allows me to quickly insert data to my google spreadsheets.

It contains a single form that makes API request to [Quicksheets-API](https://github.com/lirenyeo/quicksheets-api)

I won't be updating this repo as I plan to do a revamp of the app using Ionic 2 and AngularJS 2. [Version 2](https://github.com/lirenyeo/quicksheets-mobile-2) will include extra tabs:
* Income: *A new form for income input*
* Setting: *Allow setting for googlesheets column*
